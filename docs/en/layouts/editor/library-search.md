Library media consists of the following:

- [Images](/guide/widgets/image)
- [Audio](/guide/widgets/audio)
- [Video](/guide/widgets/video)
- Other media files

::: tip
**Other media** search includes [Flash](/guide/widgets/flash), [HTML Package](/guide/widgets/html-package), [PDF](/guide/widgets/pdf) and [PowerPoint](/guide/widgets/powerpoint) files available from the **Type** drop down menu.

## Remote Search

Integration from Pixabay gives users additional resources to Image and Video files which can be added to Layouts without having to leave the Layout Editor to source.

::: info
Pixabay integration is enabled by default for new SignaLink in the Cloud customers.

If you are upgrading from an earlier version you will need to enable by navigating to the **Administration** section of the CMS and click **Applications**. Scroll down the page to the **Connectors** section. Click to **Configure** and tick to enable, **Save** changes.
:::

- Click on **Pixabay** and select which **Type** of file to search.
- Enter search criteria in the Name field to return results.
- Drag or click to add, position/resize and configure.

::: tip
Clicking the arrow in the top right of a thumbnail will play a preview in a separate window. This window can also be enlarged using the arrow in the top left and can be added to the Layout from here by clicking the `+` button at the top.
