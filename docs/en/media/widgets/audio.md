Add Audio files to play on your Layouts and Playlists from the [Library Search](/guide/layouts/editor/library-search).

:::

## Overview

- [Upload](/guide/media/library#add-media-upload) new audio files directly to Playlists/Layouts from the [Library Search](/guide/layouts/editor/library-search).
- Files uploaded directly to Playlists and Layouts are automatically saved to the [Library](/guide/media/library) for re-use.
- Audio files can be also be uploaded in advance to the Library.

::: tip
We recommend mp3.wav file format.
:::

- Set [start and end times](/guide/media/playlists#widget-expiry-dates) for audio files uploaded directly to a Playlist.
- Save audio files to [Folders](/guide/tour/folders) on upload, to easily control access to Users.
- Uploaded audio files are cached for off-line playback.
- Fully compatible with [Overlay Layouts.](/guide/layouts/overlay)
- Control the duration of the audio file.
  - Set a lower duration to cut the original file short.

  - Set a higher duration and use the Loop function to "loop" back to the beginning to satisfy a longer duration.
- Attach Audio files to other Widgets.

Audio can also be attached to other Widgets using the [Context Menu](/guide/layouts/editor/context-menu)

::: tip
When attaching to Widgets, Users can enter a Volume as well as a Loop parameter to determine whether the audio will loop for the duration of the attached Widget or just play through once. Audio will stop once the parent Widget finishes playing!
